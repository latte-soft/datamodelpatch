# DataModelPatch

Accurate decompilation of the Roblox Player's distribution of DataModelPatch.rbxm, including the universal `LuaApp`

> [!WARNING]
> This is a WIP decompilation; it is not quite yet ready for re-compilation.

### Goal 

The goal of this decompilation is to achieve correct re-compilation of `LuaApp` and similar files. The core scripts are updated to upstream every 1-2 weeks aside from decompiler bug fixes.
